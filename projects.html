				<p> The scholarship database offers a wide variety of scholarships in various disciplines, catering to a diverse range of interests and educational levels. The database includes 
					scholarships for students pursuing degrees in STEM fields as well as non-STEM fields, and for both undergraduate and graduate students. Whether you are a student looking for funding for your undergraduate studies, or a graduate student searching for scholarships to support your post-graduate education,
					the scholarship database has something for everyone.</p>

				<h1><a href="https://github.com/barbaraaboagye/My-MachineLearning-Journey">MACHINE LEARNING</a></h1>
				<p> I developed an interest in machine learning and decided to dive into it. To keep track of my growth, I chose to document my journey on Github. By creating
				a Github repository, I am able to share my code, notes, progress, and any obstacles I come across. Despite still figuring out my preferred learning style, I am currently alternating between online courses and hands-on projects and challenges. The journey has been challenging and confusing at times, 
				so any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p>

				<p>I create informative content focused on helping individuals navigate the process of obtaining admission and scholarships to study abroad. My goal is to make
					the process as transparent as possible by sharing valuable tips and providing advice to help individuals achieve their academic and career goals. I understand the challenges that come with the process of getting admission and scholarships abroad and I aim to help others 
					overcome these obstacles and achieve their dream of studying abroad.</p>
