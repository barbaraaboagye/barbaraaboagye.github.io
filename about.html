<p>My love for education has been the central focus of my life. I am currently a PhD candidate in Civil engineering at [University of Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/),Canada and a part time Youtube content creator. My [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEYKFq7ZEg81GYxpzNqYZ4Q) focuses on xxx.</p>

<p>In 2016, I finished my undergraduate studies in civil engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.</p>
