<p><strong> 9:00 a.m. June 5, 2027 </strong>. I am standing in a room full of civil engineering students, explaining to them the importance of civil engineering, 
  the career paths available, the roles they will be playing, and how to ensure they have a holistic education before I start my lecture on 
  concrete mechanics. In my room, I have a customized drawing of this that serves as a constant source of inspiration. 
  Since the age of 16, when I volunteered as a classroom teacher, I've known I wanted to be a teacher.
  Throughout my undergraduate studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana and master's education at Ecole Centrale Nantes, France, I personally gathered and organized tutorials for both my classmates and juniors, 
  and these activities were always a source of joy for me. </p>
  
<p> I am currently a PhD candidate in civil engineering at the <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/">University of Sherbrooke,Canada</a>. My research seeks to find answers to the question, 
  " Can concrete mixtures be optimised in real time at concrete batch plants using the power consumption curve along with relationships
  between concrete mixture proportions, batching sequence, aggregate moisture content, and concrete properties?” This will help combat 
  the issue of global warming by producing high performance and low-carbon footprint concrete mixtures. Not only will this reduce drastically the carbon footprint and concrete production cost of the 
  construction industry but will make the world a more sustainable and environmentally friendly place to live.   </p>
  
  
<p> I use my social media platforms and <a href =" https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEYKFq7ZEg81GYxpzNqYZ4Q" >Youtube channel</a> as a means 
  to provide information to prospective graduate students wanting to study abroad, 
  with the aim of breaking down barriers that exist for underrepresented students. 

Over the last year, I have reviewed and provided feedback on hundreds of CVs and Statements of Purpose, as well as assisted 
  prospective graduate students with interview preparation and guidance on transitioning to and succeeding in a new environment. 

Without a scholarship or financial aid, I, like many other brilliant people, would not have been able to study abroad. These funding opportunities 
  have molded my journey as a black engineer and as the sole female black engineering student in many of the spaces where 
  I now find myself, as well as in my family. In 2022, I created a scholarship database that currently has over 700 scholarship opportunities
  in various disciplines from around the world for BSc., MSc, Ph.D., and postdoctoral students. This is to increase diversity, inclusion, and equity in academia. Through this initiative, I've been able to build a community of 
  18,000+ Twitter followers and 6,000+ YouTube subscribers, and I intend to connect underrepresented groups 
  all across the world to scholarship and funding opportunities. </p>




<p> I love to learn </p>
