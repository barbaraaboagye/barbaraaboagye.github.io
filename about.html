<p><strong> 9:00 a.m. June 5, 2027 </strong>. I am standing in a room full of civil engineering students, explaining to them the importance of civil engineering, 
  the career paths available, the roles they will be playing, and how to ensure they have a holistic education before I start my lecture on 
  concrete mechanics. In my room, I have a customized drawing of this that serves as a constant source of inspiration. 
  Since the age of 16, when I volunteered as a classroom teacher, I've known I wanted to be a teacher.
  Throughout my undergraduate studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana and master's education at Ecole Centrale Nantes, France, I personally gathered and organized tutorials for both my classmates and juniors, 
  and these activities were always a source of joy for me.Â </p>
  
<p> I am currently a PhD candidate in civil engineering at the <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/">University of 
Sherbrooke,Canada</a>. My research is focused on finding ways to optimize concrete mixtures in real time 
at batch plants, in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the construction industry and make the world 
a more sustainable place to live.   </p>
    
<p> In addition to my research and teaching, I am also committed to breaking down barriers for 
underrepresented students who want to study abroad. Through my scholarship database, which I 
created in 2022, I provide access to over 700 scholarship opportunities in various disciplines
from around the world for BSc., MSc, Ph.D., and postdoctoral students. I have been able to build a community of 18,000+ 
<a href =" https://twitter.com/awesome_ama">Twitter</a> followers and 6,000+ <a href =" https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEYKFq7ZEg81GYxpzNqYZ4Q" >YouTube</a> subscribers and connect thousands of 
students to funding opportunities through this initiative. 
I offer feedback on CVs and Statements of Purpose, and provide assistance with interview preparation and guidance on transitioning to and
succeeding in a new environment. I understand the challenges that underrepresented students face and I want to make the process of studying abroad 
more accessible and less intimidating for them.</p>


<p> I also use my platforms to share my own experiences and insights as a black female engineer, to provide inspiration and guidance for others. 
Through my platform, I hope to inspire and empower underrepresented students to pursue their passions and reach their 
full potential in their academic and professional pursuits </p>
