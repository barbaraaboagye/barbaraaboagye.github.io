<p><strong> 9:00 a.m. June 5, 2027 </strong>. I am standing in a room full of civil engineering students, explaining to them the importance of civil engineering, 
  the career paths available, the roles they will be playing, and how to ensure they have a holistic education before I start my lecture on 
  concrete mechanics. In my room, I have a customized drawing of this that serves as a constant source of inspiration. 
  Since the age of 16, when I volunteered as a classroom teacher, I've known I wanted to be a teacher.
  Throughout my undergraduate (Ghana) and master's (France) studies, I personally gathered and organized tutorials for both my classmates and juniors, 
  and these activities were always a source of joy for me. </p>
  
<p> I am currently a PhD candidate in civil engineering at the <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/">University of Sherbrooke,Canada</a>. My research seeks to find answers to the question, 
  " Can concrete mixtures be optimised in real time at concrete batch plants using the power consumption curve along with relationships
  between concrete mixture proportions, batching sequence, aggregate moisture content, and concrete properties?” This will help combat 
  the issue of global warming by producing high performance and low-carbon footprint concrete mixtures. Not only will this reduce drastically the carbon footprint and concrete production cost of the 
  construction industry but will make the world a more sustainable and environmentally friendly place to live.   </p>
