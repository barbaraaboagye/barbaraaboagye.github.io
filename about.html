<center><p><i>My love for education has been the central focus of my life. </i></p></center>

<p> 9:00 a.m. June 5, 2027. I am standing in a room full of civil engineering students, explaining to them the importance of civil engineering, 
  the career paths available, the roles they will be playing, and how to ensure they have a holistic education before I start my lecture on 
  concrete mechanics. In my room, I have a customized drawing of this that serves as a constant source of inspiration. 
  Since the age of 16, when I volunteered as a classroom teacher, I've known I wanted to be a teacher.
  Throughout my undergraduate (Ghana) and master's (France) studies, I personally gathered and organized tutorials for both my classmates and juniors, 
  and these activities were always a source of joy for me.Â </p>
