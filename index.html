    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <center><p><i>My love for education has been the central focus of my life. </i></p></center><br>

<p><strong> 9:00 a.m. June 5, 2027 </strong>. I am standing in a room full of civil engineering students, explaining to them the 
  importance of civil engineering, the career paths available, the roles they will be playing, and how to ensure they have a holistic education 
  before I start my lecture on concrete mechanics. In my room, I have a customized drawing of this that serves as a constant source of reminder of what my career goals are. 
  Since the age of 16, when I volunteered as a classroom teacher, I've known I wanted to be a teacher.
  Throughout my undergraduate studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana and master's education at Ecole Centrale Nantes, France, I personally gathered and organized tutorials for both my classmates and juniors, 
  and these activities were always a source of joy for me. </p></p>
